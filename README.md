## Problem Domain: 
NBA Stats - View stats of players and teams from the NBA based on their real-life performances.

## Application Description:
Our team is thinking about developing a statistics viewer which allows users to see the stats of their favourite NBA players and teams.

In order to use NBA Stats, users must first select a team to view. Then, they can select a player within that team in order to view their statistics. The players statistics are based on their real life performances. Upon selecting a team to view, the real-life statistics of the team will be visible to the user as well as the option to view the stats for each player on the given team. The user can select the kinds of stats that they want to see.
